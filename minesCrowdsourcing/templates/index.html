        <p>
        The Colorado School of Mines is happy to present their own crowdsourcing system.
        Here, researchers can utilize the power of crowdsourcing to study behaviors, verify data, support machine learning efforts, survey public opinions, respond to crises such as natural disasters and so on.
        Participants can complete these tasks in return for compensation. Go to <a href="{% url 'participant_all_tasks' %}">available tasks</a> to see what tasks are currently posted!
        Together, we can move Minesâ€™ research efforts forward to provide meaningful solutions to important problems.
